Changes in 0.10.0.0

	* Both type classes Mean and Variance are split in two. This
 	  is required for distributions which do not have finite
 	  variance or mean.

	* complCumulative is added to type class Distribution in order to assess
	  accurately probalities P(X>x) which is used in one-tailed tests.

	* stdDev is added to Variance type class for distributions.

	* Constructor S.Distribution.normalDistr takes standard deviation
	  instead of variance as parameter.

	* Bug in S.Quantile.weightedAvg is fixed. It produced wrong answer if
	  sample contains only one element.

	* Bug in quantile estimations for chi-square and gamma distribution is
	  fixed.

	* Integer overlow in mannWhitneyUCriticalValue is fixed. It produced
	  wrong critical value for moderately large samples. Something around 20
	  for 32-bit machines and 40 for 64-bit ones.

	* Bug in mannWhitneyUSignificant is fixed. If either of samples is larger
	  than 20 it produced completely wrong answer.

	* One and two tailed tests in S.Tests.NonParametric are selected with
	  enumeration types instead of booleans.

	* Performance improvements for Mann-Whitney U and Wilcoxon tests.

	* sortBy is added to Statistics.Function

	* Mean and variance for gamma distribution is fixed

	* Much faster cumulutive probablity functions for Poisson and
	  hyperheometric distributions.

	* Better density function for gamma and Poisson distributions.

	* Cauchy-Lorentz distrbution is added.
